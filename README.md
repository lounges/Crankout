## Crankout
A very basic breakout clone to learn the playdate sdk.

## VSCode setup:
- Assumes that the playdate sdk is installed in c:/code/PlaydateSDK
- Assumes that the PlaydateSDK/bin directory is in the system path
- Assumes you are using the playdate extension from Orta
- Assumes you are using the Lua extension from sumneko

## Todo:
- ball
- top /bottom blockers
- blocks
- hooking up crank to input
- game modes
    - waiting to start
    - playing
    - game over
- scoring
- multiple stages
